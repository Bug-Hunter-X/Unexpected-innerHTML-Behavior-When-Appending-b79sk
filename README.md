# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected innerHTML Behavior

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the usage of `innerHTML` in HTML and JavaScript.  The goal is to append new content to an existing div, but due to the incorrect use of `innerHTML`, the initial content is entirely replaced. This can lead to unexpected behavior and data loss in more complex scenarios.

## Bug Description

The primary issue lies in how `innerHTML` is used. By assigning a new value to `innerHTML`, the existing content is entirely overwritten. When we intend to append, we should utilize other methods like `insertAdjacentHTML` or DOM manipulation methods for a more robust approach.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates how to correctly append content using `insertAdjacentHTML`. This method efficiently adds new content to a specific location within the existing HTML without replacing the original content.
